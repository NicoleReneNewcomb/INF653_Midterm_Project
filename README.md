## PostgreSQL Database Hosted on Render.com

## Description of Project
This project uses a PostgreSQL database to hold information about famous quotes. Within the database, there are quotes, authors, and categories tables. The REST API itself is created using PHP. It responds to GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests at the endpoints /quotes, /authors/, and /categories. Such requests allow interactions with the database, including the creation, reading, updating, and deletion of records (CRUD functions).
